      <h2>Expedition: Catastrophe</h2>
      <p>In this room there was a explorer who's plan crashed recently. You and your friends went to explore the site. The scrap parts of the wing fall down behind you, trapping you. You discover an oil leak, which you estimate will explode within an hour. With the exits blocked and time ticking, you must dig through the explorer's journals and maps to figure out where the emergency exit is.</p>

      <h2>House of the Occult</h2>
      <p>A fun prank has gone wrong. Your best friend, George, tried to pull a practical joke involving a haunted house. He invited you and his other friends, but when you got there, only a pile of blood and bones were all that was left of George. You fell a horrible sensation, and knowing that you will die if you don't hurry, you desperately try to find a way out.</p>

      <h2>In the Belly of the Bronze Beast</h2>
      <p>You took a job as the operator of a new machine in which you were not told the purpose of. A week after you were hired, the machine breaks down, causing all of the exits to shut. There is another exit, but it locked and is opened by a code only your boss knows. Luckily, he is a forgetful man, meaning he has left clues all around the operating room that help to solve the code. Will you crack the code before you overheat?</p>

      <h2>Illusory</h2>
      <p>Hello my esteemed friend! It is Karl. If you are recieving this letter, I have kicked the bucket. I have dedicated $100,000 dollars to each of my friends in an act of pure charity. There is a catch, however. To recieve this money, you must complete a series of puzzles located in my mansion. I would suggest working together with the others, as the puzzles require more than one person to solve. Good luck and farewell!</p>
